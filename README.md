### Algorithms Overview

- **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model where an internal node represents a feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.
  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression, where the output is a class membership based on the majority of its k nearest neighbors.
  
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.
  
- **Genetic Algorithm**: A search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection to evolve solutions to optimization and search problems.
  
- **Differential Evolution**: A stochastic, population-based optimization algorithm that uses differences between population members to search the parameter space.
  
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.
  
- **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**: A class of feedforward artificial neural network where connections between the units do not form a cycle.
